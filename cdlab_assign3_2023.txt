Consider the following grammar 
E->E+T|T
T->T*F|F
F->(E)|i
Write C programs to the following 
1. Construct an operator precedence parser.
2. Construct a shift-reduce parser.
The programs will display the derivation of an input string 
and finally report its acceptance or error.

Input1:  (i+i)*i$
Output1: accept

Input2:  (i+i*i$
Output2: Error: closing parenthesis missing at position 5

Input3:  +i*i$
Output3: Error: operand missing before + at position 1
